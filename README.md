senior design

submitted final version of my senior design project. 

our goal was to design a simplified video chatting application for use by the elderly. 

a key feature was the ability to draw on top of the image, like snapchat.

we sort of threw it together at the end, not going to lie. the core functionality is there, but we wanted to add a buddy list feature towards the end, so that was tacked on..changing requirements at the last minute woo. 

i worked on the buddy list feature. it utilizes a couple databases to figure out who's online, who's a friend, etc. 

doesn't quite work anymore because the databases were hosted by Microsoft's Azure during the free trial period, and it's not hosted anymore. 



I might come back to work on this mess a little, but...EH. 

haa
